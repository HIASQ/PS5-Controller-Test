PS5 Controller Tester
This is a simple, AI-assisted web application designed to test the functionality of a PlayStation 5 (PS5) DualSense controller. It leverages the Web Gamepad API, making it accessible directly through the web browsers built into modern gaming consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox, as well as on standard desktop browsers.

The page provides visual feedback for button presses, analog stick movements, and trigger pressure, along with raw data outputs for detailed analysis.

üöÄ Features
Controller Connection Status: Clearly indicates whether a controller is connected and displays its ID.

Button Testing: Visualizes presses for all standard PS5 buttons (Square, Cross, Circle, Triangle, L1, R1, L2, R2, Share, Options, L3, R3, D-Pad, PS Button, Touchpad).

Analog Stick Visualization: Dynamically shows the position of the Left and Right analog sticks with a moving indicator.

Trigger Feedback: Displays the pressure applied to the L2 and R2 triggers through fill indicators.

Raw Data Display: Provides live, raw data for all axes (analog sticks, triggers) and button values in JSON format, useful for debugging and detailed analysis.

üéÆ How to Use
Access the Page: Open the HTML file in a web browser.

On PS5/Xbox: Use the console's built-in web browser (e.g., PlayStation's web browser, Edge on Xbox) to navigate to the hosted page or open the local HTML file if you can access it.

On PC/Mac: Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Connect Your Controller: Ensure your PS5 controller is paired and connected to the console or device running the web page.

Interact: Press buttons, move analog sticks, and squeeze triggers on your PS5 controller. The web page will visually update in real-time, showing which inputs are being registered.

Observe Raw Data: The "Raw Data" sections at the bottom will display the precise values from the controller's axes and buttons.
